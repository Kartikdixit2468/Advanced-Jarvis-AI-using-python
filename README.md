# Jarvis-AI-using-python
Jarvis 2.0 can do daily common tasks like opening any application, searching on Google about something, playing songs, checking your internet speed, and many more just with your Voice.                         
You can say "Jarvis {Your task}" like - "Jarvis Play the nights" Here, the "Jarvis" word works like an activation prompt for this Voice Assistant.                                                               
In this project, I have used Python to automate Bard AI and some other websites for voice recognition, etc, and some prebuilt models of SKlearn to make predictions.
